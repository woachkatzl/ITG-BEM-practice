### Usage
To use and navigate the page created in this project follow [this link](https://woachkatzl.github.io/ITG-BEM-practice/)
- Two pages available are the home page, which loads when landing, and the "Возможности" (Features) page - the first link in the navigation at the bottom of the home page.
- The site has three primary screen size options: mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Changing the size of your browser window will change the size and placement of page elements to maintain readable and appealing layout.
- The Features page is made using CSS grid to maintain a structure layout.
- Hovering over links will change their color and the appearance of the cursor.
- Hovering over buttons will change the appearance of the cursor.
- When hovering over a section on the Features page a frame will appear around the section.
- Clicking on the logo at the top left corner of the page will bring you to the home page.
